# The Burrito Project

The application renders a map (using Google Maps API) that uses the browser's location to plot all the closest burrito-serving shops nearby. The locations are listed by order of proximity to the user (based on Google Maps distance ranking). 

The user also has the ability to obtain directions to any/all of the burrito locations by simply selecting the desired place in the lefthand panel. The step-by-step directions are listed underneath the location, as well as the directions being plotted interactively on the map.
